# Examples of **What HTTP/2 Means to Java Developers**
   * [Low-level HTTP/2 client example](src/test/java/eu/redzoo/article/javaworld/http2/LowLevelHttp2ClientTest.java)
   * [High-level HTTP/2 client example](src/test/java/eu/redzoo/article/javaworld/http2/HighLevelHttp2ClientTest.java)
   * [HTTP/2 push example](src/test/java/eu/redzoo/article/javaworld/http2/Http2PushTest.java)
   
Please consider that the examples use *direct* negotiation as well as an embedded jetty server. By modifying the examples to call http2-supporting pages you have to add and configure SSL in the example code.
